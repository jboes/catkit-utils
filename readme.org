In the effort to make CatKit's testing suit and requirements more light weight, I removed some of the API features meant to interface with heavier packages.

These API are still useful, but to help make CatKit more accessible to contributions from other developers, they will live separately for the foreseeable future.

Any API housed here is made generally available through the [[./LICENSE][GPLv3 Licence]], but no testing of the functions is provided. Use at your own risk.
